               <dt class="question">What is the mission of ASB?</dt>
               <dd class="answer hidden"> Alternative Student Breaks seeks to educate Northwestern University students about specific social issues by immersing them in service-learning activities in a wide array of communities across the country. A student-run, student-driven organization, ASB strives to encourage lifelong social action by involving, educating, and heightening students’ social awareness during their time at Northwestern. <br />
                  <br />
                  Since its inception at Northwestern in 1994, thousands of Wildcats have taken advantage of Alternative Student Breaks trips, speakers, and events. </dd>
               <br />
               <dt class="question">Why go on an ASB trip?</dt>
               <dd class="answer hidden"> Alternative Student Breaks provides the unique opportunity to learn about and embrace three distinct things: your peers, an important social issue, and an interesting region of the country (or world). Every ASB trip brings together a diverse mix of Northwestern students from all areas of campus, while immersing the group in a specific issue and geographic region. The magical fusion of these three things creates an unforgettable week.  It is something you can’t pass up during your time at Northwestern. </dd>
               <br />
               <dt class="question">How do I go on an ASB trip?</dt>
               <dd class="answer hidden"> It's easy! You just have to fill out and turn in the Trip Placement Application, which is released along with respective sites.  For Winter Break trips, this happens in early October; for Spring Break trips, this happens in mid-January. The application is used to place you on a trip of particular interest with other students who have similar interests and passions. Upon trip placement, participants are notified by their two Site Leaders and begin the rewarding process of going on an ASB trip. </dd>
               <br />
               <dt class="question">How much do trips cost? Is there financial aid?</dt>
               <dd class="answer hidden"> ASB trips vary widely in price. Driving trips range from $180 - $300, depending on distance. Flying trips typically cost $500+.  This price (described in the next question) covers all costs. <br />
                  <br />
                  Financial aid is available for ASB trips.  ASB Exec, Site Leaders, and Participants fundraise year-round to help provide financial aid to everyone who needs it.  Financial aid packages include ASB Scholarships, payment plans, and extra fundraising opportunities. </dd>
               <br />
               <dt class="question">What does my fee pay for?</dt>
               <dd class="answer hidden"> ASB trips are budgeted to create the most widely affordable, yet comfortable, experience for all participants. The fee includes ALL the week’s expenses, with the exception of food while driving/flying; it covers all food, lodging, and travel expenses for the week, as well as an ASB t-shirt and some extra money for each trip to spend on an adventure of its choosing. </dd>

Getting people excited about ASB is critical to spreading ASB’s mission on- and off-campus. The Street Crew is responsible for designing and organizing flyers, banners, and firesides and munchies at dorms, residential colleges, and Greek houses.  Without the Street Crew, ASB could barely get participants!</dd>
