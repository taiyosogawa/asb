                  <dt class="question">What are the dates for the trip?</dt>
                  <dd class="answer hidden">All ASB trips will depart from campus on Wednesday, September 12th 2012.  We will return to campus the evening of Tuesday, September 18th, and our programming ends at 9:00AM on Thursday, September 20th (move-in day). </dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt class="question">How do I apply to go on a Pre-Wildcat Welcome Week ASB trip?</dt>
                  <dd class="answer hidden">The Alternative Student Breaks application will be available online in early May <a href="apply.html">here</a>.  ASB shares a common application with all four of Northwestern's Pre-Wildcat Welcome Week Programs.</dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt class="question">I don't have a lot of volunteer experience.  Can I still go on an ASB trip?</dt>
                  <dd class="answer hidden">Of course! No prior volunteer experience is required, and many participants have never volunteered before. ASB is a great way for everyone to become more involved with service. </dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt class="question">Where are we staying during the trip?</dt>
                  <dd class="answer hidden">All trips will stay on location or near the volunteer sites.   Most trips will be staying in a local church or a youth hostel.  The housing sites will have a kitchen facility, a shower, a bathroom, and a place to lay out sleeping bags. Students will receive more detailed information about their housing site once they have been accepted into the program.</dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt class="question">What should I pack?</dt>
                  <dd class="answer hidden">Participants should only bring what they will need for the week. We strongly encourage you to pack lightly, as you will be responsible for carrying your own luggage. Each trip requires different attire and supplies. Participants will receive a detailed packing list from their site leaders in early August after they are assigned to a trip. </dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt class="question">Does ASB provide storage for the extra luggage I want move into my dorm room?</dt>
                  <dd class="answer hidden">Participants should only bring the luggage they need for the week-long trip, as there is a very limited amount of storage at Norris University Center for additional baggage. We  recommend that families meet their student on Thursday, September 20th (Move-In Day) to bring the student's belongings for the year, or ship their belongings ahead of time. Site leaders will be on hand on Move-In day to help participants move in. </dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt class="question">If I go on ASB, will I miss any of Wildcat Welcome Week?</dt>
                  <dd class="answer hidden">All ASB trips will return to campus Tuesday, September 18th, and our programming will be completed by 9AM on Thursday, September 20th.  Participants will not miss any of Wildcat Welcome Week, and in fact will be among the first students to move into their dorms.</dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt class="question">What if my family needs to contact me during the trip?</dt>
                  <dd class="answer hidden">In case of emergency, parents may call the Center for Student Involvement (847-491-2350) during regular business hour.  They will then contact one of the site leaders and locate the student. Site leaders will be in constant mobile contact with the Center for Student Involvement.  Students may bring their cell phones on the trip, but they will be encouraged to leave them off while working at the site. After the we return from the site, the site leaders will provide a time for students to call home, however, we encourage personal cell phone usage to be kept to a minimum.</dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt class="question">What are site leader qualifications?</dt>
                  <dd class="answer hidden">All ASB site leaders have completed a twelve-week training course on service-learning and facilitating positive  group dynamics.  Each ASB trip will have two site leaders whose purpose is to facilitate service-learning, ensure the safety of the participants, and serve as a source of information and advice about the transition from high school to college life.   All site leaders have taken a defensive driving course and are CPR and First Aid certified.</dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt class="question">If ASB trips return to campus on the 18th, can I leave the group that night?</dt>
                  <dd class="answer hidden">Even though our trips return to campus on the night of the 18th, our program does not end until 9 am on Thursday, September 20th.  Participants will not be allowed to leave the group until the program ends.</dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt class="question">When can my parents meet me to help me move in?</dt>
                  <dd class="answer hidden">All ASB programming will be completed by 9AM on Thursday, Sept. 20th. Families may meet participants at Norris University Center or their dorms anytime after 9AM.  ASB site leaders will help direct students to their residence halls/colleges, and will also be available to help students move into their dorm rooms.</dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt class="question">How much does it cost to go on an ASB trip?</dt>
                  <dd class="answer hidden">$215.</dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt class="question">What does the cost cover?</dt>
                  <dd class="answer hidden">The $215 is very comprehensive. It covers housing, site fees, food during the week, and gas. However, for the two travel days, participants will need to pay for their own meals. For those days, we make stops at inexpensive restaurants that can acommodate dietary needs. Participants are encouraged to bring around $50 in spending money for souveniers, meals on travel days, and the like.</dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt class="question">Does ASB provide financial aid?</dt>
                  <dd class="answer hidden">Yes.  ASB works with the financial aid office to determine a student's eligibility for aid.  The amount of financial assistance given by ASB is based on the amount of aid the participant receives from the university.</dd>
                  <br />
                  <dt class="question">Additional notes</dt>
                  <dd class="answer hidden">Illegal Drugs and Alcohol will not be tolerated during ASB.  All participants will be required to sign a Substance Abuse Waiver, and this policy will be strictly enforced during the trips.  Participants who do not abide by program rules will be sent home at their own expense - no exceptions. During the trips participants will not be permitted to leave the group for other activities (e.g., to meet family or friends in the area). </dd>
