            <div class="span9"> Welcome to the Pre-WWW section of the ASB website! Navigate the tabs on the left for all the juicy details on ASB's Pre-WWW trip. <br />
               <br />
               We send teams of incoming freshmen on service-learning trips before the University's orientation. We partner with established non-profit organizations across the Midwest to offer unique hands-on experiences, giving students the chance to learn from the local community. Students are accompanied by two trained site leaders who facilitate service-learning and prepare incoming freshmen for life at Northwestern. Not only do ASBers hit the ground running upon return to campus, they become a part of the ASB community, a group with a year-round presence and opportunities for involvement. This year's Pre-WWW ASB trips will begin on Wednesday, September   12th, 2012 and will end the morning of move-in day, Thursday, September 20th.

               Starting college is one of the most exciting times in your life, but it can also be one of the most nerve-wracking. We believe that an ASB trip is the perfect transition from high school to college. You'll build lasting friendships with incoming students and have the opportunity to step outside your comfort zone by learning about yourself, your peers, and an important social issue, all while having boatloads of fun. When you choose ASB, you:
               <ul class="offset1">
                  <li>Have an entire week to ask questions and learn about life at NU before you even reach campus</li>
                  <li>Gain in-depth knowledge about a specific social or environmental issue</li>
                  <li>Make a difference in the community you visit</li>
                  <li>Start college off the right way... with a road trip!</li>
                  <li>Explore a new city for a week</li>
                  <li>Make close friends on your trip and meet lots of new ASBers on our all-ASB Chicago day trip</li>
                  <li>Enlist your site leaders to haul your items to your room on move-in day</li>
                  <li>Enjoy membership in the ASB community with ongoing volunteer and leadership opportunities</li>
               </ul>
